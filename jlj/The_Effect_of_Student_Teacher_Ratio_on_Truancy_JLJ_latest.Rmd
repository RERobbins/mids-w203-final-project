# Introduction

## Motivation
"If you want to be cool, stay in school!" said the PSA from the Council for Basic Education. For decades generations of children have heard the message about the importance of staying in school. According to a 2007 study published by [Allensworth and Easton](https://consortium.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/2018-10/07%20What%20Matters%20Final.pdf), "course attendance is eight times more predictive of course failure in the freshman year than eighth-grade test scores." This is an astounding revelation and addressing the issue of truancy should, therefore, be a large motivating factor for all stakeholders in the education system -- from students, to parents, to teachers, and administrative staff -- to ensure their students' success. Additionally truancy may be an indicator of future antisocial behavior and has also been linked to poor socio-economic and socio-emotional outcomes.

According to the [US Department of Education](https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/chronicabsenteeism.html) the slippery slope of chronic truancy begins in early childhood, from preschool to first grade. As described in the report by [Professor Donald J. Hernandez](https://assets.aecf.org/m/resourcedoc/AECF-DoubleJeopardy-2012-Full.pdf), children at this level who exhibit chronic truancy are less likely to read at grade level by the third grade translating to a four times likelihood of dropping out of high school. Dropping out of high school, which students who exhibit chronic truancy are likely to experience, is linked to poor financial status, poor health, and involvement with the criminal justice system in adulthood. To put this issue into context, over 7 million students, roughly 1 in 6, missed 15 or more days of school in 2015-2016.

Truancy is a major problem.

## Research Question
In this report we study the research question: _"Do pupil-teacher ratios in public schools affect truancy rates?"_

Our theory is that decreasing the number of students per teacher decreases the rate of unexcused absences (the truancy rate). We worked from data collected and published by the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) as required by the United States Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. In order to avoid the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic we looked only at the 2018-2019 school year.

Additionally we examined other factors that may also influence truancy like wealth and teacher salary.

While there is a possibility that a feedback loop between truancy and pupil-teacher ratio exists, we believe this to be of minor consequence because school funding and budgeting comes in fiscal year cycles and any meaningful changes to the pupil-teacher ratio during the school year will be limited.

The findings in this study will help public school administrators and educators make better-informed decisions about staffing levels within their districts to help decrease student truancy and increase their students' success.

# Causal Model

**The following paragraph will be enhanced.  It is here as a placeholder.**
The causes of truancy are many. Our causal model graph examines a few that are reasonable observations from the data we have collected, namely Pupil-Teacher Ratio, Average Teacher Salary, Lunch Subsidy Eligibility (a proxy for wealth), and whether or not an individual school was a Charter School. We believe these variables to be the most relevant in the dataset available. Certainly, there are other factors that contribute to the Truancy Rate and, for the purpose of this report, we will keep those within our Epsilon value.

# Research Design

**To Be Updated**

We designed our research as a quantitative study which takes a deductive approach and provides an explanation about the relationship among variables in the study to test the broader theory outlined in the Introduction section of this report. Most of the measurements discussed and used in our regression are metric in nature with the exception of our proxy variable for wealth (lunch subsidy eligibility)  which, as previously discussed, is reported as metric data in the original dataset, but converted to categorical data in order to satisfy the requirements of this assignment.

# Data

## Unit of Observation

While we gathered data at both individual school and school district levels we concluded that our study would be based on school district level data. 

Looking at individual schools provides a more granular perspective and many more data points. It also permits us to explore the impact of whether a school is a charter school or not. However, not all schools offer the same mix of grades (even amongst a given level, such as middle schools) and we suspect that the impact of pupil-teacher ratios on truancy varies with student age (grade level). Thus, we did not want to draw conclusions solely from a review of school level data.

Additionally, we do not have access to grade-level truancy by school or school district, or teacher salary information by school. As we explored the data we found that individual school data, without the ability to further partition by grades, was not helpful. To address potential data bias at the school level due to differing grade level mixtures, we opted to rely on analysis at the school district level. School districts have a mix of students at all grade levels. We did not explore the degree to which the distribution of students by grade is consistent across school districts but we believe it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of students by age across school districts would be more consistent than looking at individual schools. One consequence of working at the school district-level is that we were unable to use information about individual school type (charter or non-charter schools) that we collected, which would likely have provided useful additional information.

When necessary we derive district level data by aggregating school level data.

## Dependent, Explanatory, and Background Variables

### Truancy Rate

The dependent variable in our research question is `truancy_rate`. In simplest terms, it is the ratio of the number of unexcused days absent to the total number of possible days attended. So, if there are $100$ students and $200$ days of school in a measurement period, the total number of possible days attended would be $20,000$. If there were $75$ unexcused absences during the period, the truancy rate would be $\frac{75}{20,000}$ or `r round(75/20000,5)`.

The CDE provides school level truancy data. We derive school district truancy data by aggregating school level data. For a detailed discussion of truancy rates in Colorado and related school attendance information see [link](https://www.cde.state.co.us/cdereval/truancystatistics). As we discuss below, Colorado schools self- report truancy information and do not have a consistent definition of unexcused absence. That calls into question the ability to compare truancy data across schools. We proceed with our study acknowledging that limitation.

The pair of plots below show that the distribution of `truancy_rate` is compressed on the left hand side of the x axis at values up to approximately $2.5\%$.  The right plot below shows the distribution of `log(truancy_rate)`.

```{r truancy plots, fig.height=2, fig.width=10, fig.align='center'}
plot_truancy_d <- df.d %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = truancy_rate) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = hist_color, fill = hist_fill, size = hist_size) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  xlab ("truancy rate")

plot_truancy_log_d <- df.d %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = log(truancy_rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = hist_color, fill = hist_fill, size = hist_size) +
  xlab("log(truancy rate)")

plot_truancy_d + plot_truancy_log_d +
  plot_annotation(title = "Truancy Rate Distribution") &
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Pupil-Teacher Ratio

The explanatory variable that is the focus of our analysis is `pupil_teacher_fte_ratio`.  It is the ratio of the number of students at a point in time divided by the full time equivalency of teaching assignments serving these students at that time.  The CDE measures pupil-teacher ratios on October 1 and provides school level data.  We derive school district truancy data from school level data.  See  [link](https://www.cde.state.co.us/cdereval/rvdefine).  

The plot below shows the distribution of `pupil_teacher_fte_ratio`.  We do not believe further transformation is warranted.

```{r pupil-teacher ratio plots, fig.height=2, fig.width=5, fig.align='center'}
plot_pt_ratio_d <- df.d %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = pupil_teacher_fte_ratio) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = hist_color, fill = hist_fill, size = hist_size) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  xlab ("pupil-teacher ratio")

#plot_pt_ratio_log_d <- df.d %>% 
#  ggplot() +
#  aes(x = log(pupil_teacher_fte_ratio)) +
#  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = hist_color, fill = hist_fill, size = hist_size) +
#  xlab("log (pupil-teacher ratio)")

plot_pt_ratio_d +
  plot_annotation(title = "Pupil-Teacher Ratio Distribution") &
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Average Salary

Our models include `average_salary` as a background variable.  The CDE provides average teacher salary at the district level.  

The plot below shows the distribution of `average_teacher_salary`.  We do not believe further transformation is warranted.

```{r average salary plot, fig.height=2, fig.width=5, fig.align='center'}

plot_average_salary <- df.d %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = average_salary) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25, color = hist_color, fill = hist_fill, size = hist_size) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  xlab ("average teacher salary")

plot_average_salary +
  plot_annotation(title = "Average Teacher Salary Distribution") &
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Subsidy Levels

```{r capture lunch subsidy metrics}
subsidy_stats <- awesome_data$subsidy_stats
subsidy_summary <- summary(df.d$lunch_subsidy_eligibility)
percent.low <- round(subsidy_summary[1]/sum(subsidy_summary) * 100, 2)
percent.avg <- round(subsidy_summary[2]/sum(subsidy_summary) * 100, 2)
percent.high <- round(subsidy_summary[3]/sum(subsidy_summary) * 100, 2)
```

Our models include `lunch_subsidy_level` as a background variable which we intend as a proxy for wealth. It is a factor with values `low`, `avg` and `high` and reflects whether the school district in question has a low, average or high percentage of students eligible for free or reduced fee lunches.  Higher subsidy levels correspond with lower community wealth.  

The variable is based on the distribution of students eligible for free or reduced lunches across the state. If the school district has an eligible population rate within one standard deviation of the mean, we assigned an average lunch subsidy level. School districts with an eligibility rate above or below one standard deviation of the mean are assigned high or low subsidy levels, respectively.  We were not aware of any generally accepted method for binning a population under similar circumstances.  We believe our approach to be reasonable.  The CDE reports the number and percentage of students in each school district who are eligible for free or reduced fee lunches.  

Our approach resulted in a mean eligibility percentage of `r round(subsidy_stats$mean * 100,2)`% and a standard deviation of `r round(subsidy_stats$sd * 100,2)`% with corresponding cut-off points for low subsidy districts at `r round(subsidy_stats$low * 100,2)`% and for high subsidy districts at `r round(subsidy_stats$high * 100,2)`%. Using these cut-off points resulted in `r percent.avg`% school districts at the average subsidy level, `r percent.low`% school districts at the low subsidy level, and `r percent.high`% school districts at the high subsidy level.

The plots below show the distribution of subsidy levels and a histogram of the underlying eligibility percentages from which the `lunch_subsidy_level` factor variable was derived.  School districts are comprised of a mix of communities with different degrees of wealth.  By working at the school district level we see a likely over representation of average communities as high and low wealth communities are mixed inside school districts.

```{r lunch subsidy plots, fig.height=2, fig.width=8, fig.align='center'}

plot_lunch_subsidy_levels_bar <- df.d %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = lunch_subsidy_eligibility) +
  geom_bar(color = hist_color, fill = hist_fill, size = hist_size) +
  xlab("Subsidy Eligibility Level")

plot_lunch_subsidy_levels_hist <- df.d %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = percent_free_and_reduced) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, color = hist_color, fill = hist_fill, size = hist_size) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  xlab("Subsidy Eligibility Percentage")

plot_lunch_subsidy_levels_bar + plot_lunch_subsidy_levels_hist +
  plot_annotation(title = "Lunch Subsidy Eligibility") &
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Source Data

We used publicly available data maintained by the CDE.  When we had difficulty navigating the CDE web site we were helped by a CDE analyst who helped us locate the data we sought or confirmed that it was not available.  In order to avoid the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic we looked at the 2018-2019 school year.

Our analysis is based on data that we assembled from the following six datasets.

1. 2018 - 2019 Membership Grade by School at [link](https://www.cde.state.co.us/cdereval/2018-19pk-12membershipgradelevelbyschool)
2. School Building Codes at [link](https://www.cde.state.co.us/datapipeline/2019-20listofcoloradoschoolcodes)

## Data Consolidation

We build our reference data sets from the six data sets listed above.  The source code we used to assemble our data sets accompanies this report.  This section of the report summarizes the data pipeline and the most relevant decisions we made.

1. We begin with the Membership Grade by School data and eliminate pre-schools, home school organizations, online schools, rows identified as not being associated with schools, and schools in prisons.  After removing those schools, we retain county, district and individual school identification numbers and names.
    * We exclude information for pre-schools because truancy is only measured begining with first grade (six year old students).
    * We exclude home school and online schools as attendance and truancy concepts with respect to those schools is not withing the scope of this study.  The CDE maintains a list of online schools at [link](https://www.cde.state.co.us/onlinelearning/schools).
    * We exclude various rows specifically labeled as not being associated with schools.
    * We exclude data with respect to prison schools as not meaningful for this study.

2. We reference the School Building Codes dataset which identifies whether schools are charter schools and join that information to our working dataset.  This information is only relevant for analysis at the school level and since we decided to base this exercise on school district data, the charter information we collected was not used.

3. We reference the Attendancy and Truancy Rates by School dataset to add attendance and truancy information to our working dataset.  We eliminate schools with less than ten reported unexcused absences in a year as being implausible.
    * Attendance and truancy data is self-reported by Colorado schools.  We consider it implausible that a school could have less than ten unexcused absences in a year and do not consider the information with respect to schools reporting unexcused absences at that level as being reliable.  We removed 30 schools from the dataset for this reason, including 23 that reported no unexcused absences for a full school year and four others that reported less than three unexcused absences.
    
4. We reference the Student Teacher Ratio dataset to add the student teacher ratio data to our working dataset.

5. We reference the Subsidized Lunch dataset to derive the `lunch_subsidy_level` value for each school district.

6. We reference the Average Teacher Salary by District dataset to add the `average_salary` to our dataset.

We assembled our working school district dataset by grouping and aggregating data from the relevant individual school dataset when we did not have data at the school district level.

Our data covers `r count(df.d)` school districts comprised of `r count(awesome_data$consolidated.school)` schools and a total of `r sum(df.d$enrollment)` students during the 2018 - 2019 school year.

# Modeling

We run four models. The variables in our models correspond to the variables identified in our causal model. In each of our models we apply a log transformation to the `truancy_rate` and `pupil_teacher_ratio` variables because they are both skewed and very compressed. In each case a log transformation makes sense to reduce the skewness of our data. We use robust standard errors in all of our models. Table \@ref(tab:stargazer-district) presents the regression model coefficients, standard errors, and related statistics for the models. We summarize the highlights of those results below.

## Base Model

Our base model includes only the explanatory variable that is the focus of this study, `pupil_teacher_fte_ratio`.

$$
log(truancy\_rate) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 pupil\_teacher\_fte\_ratio
$$
The `pupil_teacher_fte_ratio` variable is significant in our base model.  The coefficient is `r format (round (model_1$coefficients["pupil_teacher_fte_ratio"], 3),scientific=F)` (`r format(round(model_1.se["pupil_teacher_fte_ratio"], 3), scientific = F)`) with $p$ < 0.001.  It is difficult to say more given that the base model does not include any other variables.

## Second Model

In our second model we introduce the `lunch_subsidy_eligibility` variable.  

$$
\begin{aligned}
log(truancy\_rate) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 pupil\_teacher\_fte\_ratio\ + \beta_2 avg\_subsidy + \beta_3 high\_subsidy
\end{aligned}
$$
The `lunch_subsidy_eligibility` variable is a factor variable with a low level subsidy reflected in $\beta_0$.  In this model, each of the coefficients for subsidy levels is significant and the coefficient for the `pupil_teacher_ratio` variable remains significant.

## Third Model

We are interested in the impact of `lunch_subsidy_eligibility`  on the outcome variable as well as the `pupil_teacher_fte_ratio` variable.  Accordingly, in our third model we introduce an interaction between `lunch_subsidy_eligibility` and `pupil_teacher_fte_ratio`.  To avoid the need to calculate adjustments to a base coefficient impounded in the model and since every school district has a subsidy level, we substitute the interaction variable for the pupil-teacher ratio that was included in the first two models.  No information is lost by virtue of this approach.

$$
\begin{aligned}
log(truancy\_rate) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 avg\_subsidy + \beta_2 high\_subsidy + \\
\beta_3 \cdot low\_subsidy\_eligibility \cdot pupil\_teacher\_fte\_ratio\ + \\
\beta_4 \cdot avg\_subsidy\_eligibility \cdot pupil\_teacher\_fte\_ratio\ + \\
\beta_5 \cdot high\_subsidy\_eligibility \cdot pupil\_teacher\_fte\_ratio 
\end{aligned}
$$
In this model the `pupil_teacher_fte_ratio` is not significant at the low subsidy level (which corresponds to populations with above average wealth).  The coefficients for average and high subsidy interaction terms are 
`r format (round (model_3$coefficients["lunch_subsidy_eligibilityAVG:pupil_teacher_fte_ratio"], 3),scientific=F)` 
(`r format(round(model_3.se["lunch_subsidy_eligibilityAVG:pupil_teacher_fte_ratio"], 3), scientific = F)`) and 
`r format (round (model_3$coefficients["lunch_subsidy_eligibilityHIGH:pupil_teacher_fte_ratio"], 3),scientific=F)` 
(`r format(round(model_3.se["lunch_subsidy_eligibilityHIGH:pupil_teacher_fte_ratio"], 3), scientific = F)`), respectively.

## Fourth Model

In our fourth model we add the `average_salary` variable.  For more convenient presentation, we convert from dollars to dollars in thousands in the model.  

$$
\begin{aligned}
log(truancy\_rate) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 avg\_subsidy + \beta_2 high\_subsidy + \\
\beta_3 \cdot low\_subsidy\_eligibility \cdot pupil\_teacher\_fte\_ratio\ + \\
\beta_4 \cdot avg\_subsidy\_eligibility \cdot pupil\_teacher\_fte\_ratio\ + \\
\beta_5 \cdot high\_subsidy\_eligibility \cdot pupil\_teacher\_fte\_ratio\ + \\
\beta_6 \cdot \frac{average\_salary}{1000}
\end{aligned}
$$
The salary variable is not significant.  Consistent with the third model, `pupil_teacher_fte_ratio` is not significant at the low subsidy level and the coefficient increases as the subsidy level increases from the average subsidy level to the high subsidy level. The coefficients for average and high subsidy interaction terms are 
`r format (round (model_4$coefficients["lunch_subsidy_eligibilityAVG:pupil_teacher_fte_ratio"], 3),scientific=F)` 
(`r format(round(model_4.se["lunch_subsidy_eligibilityAVG:pupil_teacher_fte_ratio"], 3), scientific = F)`) and 
`r format (round (model_4$coefficients["lunch_subsidy_eligibilityHIGH:pupil_teacher_fte_ratio"], 3),scientific=F)` 
(`r format(round(model_4.se["lunch_subsidy_eligibilityHIGH:pupil_teacher_fte_ratio"], 3), scientific = F)`), respectively.

Table \@ref(tab:stargazer-district) presents the regression model coefficients, standard errors and related statistics for the models when applied to the school district level data. 

The `pupil_teacher_ratio` variable is significant in each of our models.  However, when we introduce the interaction with the `lunch_subsidy_eligibility` variable, `pupil_teacher_ratio` becomes insignificant at the low subsidy level (which corresponds to high wealth populations).  The `pupil_teacher_ratio` variable is more powerful at the high subsidy level compared to the average subsidy level, which is to say that it has more of an impact in less wealthy communities.

As we discuss in other parts of this report, each school not only self-reports the data to the CDE, schools also have flexibility to define what constitutes an unexcused absence. One school's excused absence could be another school's unexcused absence. That gives us pause.

As we noted above it was hard to get meaningful signals from the school level data. We suspect that the causes of truancy may vary by age and that we either need to assess the situation on a grade by grade basis or assemble collections of schools with a reasonably consistent mix of grade levels in order to account for grade-by-grade variation. If that theory is correct, it may help to explain why we were able to get better information with the district level dataset than the school level data set. There could just be too much noise at the individual school level.

# Model Limitations

## Statistical Limitations

Our study aggregates school-level data up to the district-level, reducing the sample size by an order of magnitude. The resulting sample size is `r format(nrow(df.d))`, thus the large-sample model assumptions apply to the ordinary least squares regression used in our modeling:

1. Independent and identically-distributed data (I.I.D.) \
2. A unique best linear predictor (B.L.P.)

### I.I.D.

The underlying population of our data is made up of schools and districts in Colorado's public school system. Schools, by their very nature, are clustered geographically and, as a result, socially clustered (see prior discussion on omission of non-traditional schools such as home schools and online schools). Children typically attend schools that are most proximate to their home address, so schools tend to represent features of the surrounding residents. Just as there is population variance of certain features across neighborhoods, schools in a district will tend to have clustered features. This lack of independence persists when school-level data is aggregated to the district-level. Though districts may contain a variety of schools, they are still limited geographically. As a result, this data is not independent and results from this study may not apply generally to public schools and districts. However, the relationships studied are still of practical significance and may be informative of population clusters (e.g., public schools with high levels of lunch subsidy eligibility).

Though not independent, the data is identically-distributed. Each school and each district belongs to the same probability distribution respectively, as seen in the variable exploration conducted in an earlier section.

### Unique B.L.P.

To satisfy the assumption of a unique B.L.P., we must identify that a B.L.P. exists and then ensure that it is not perfectly collinear. A B.L.P. exists if there are finite covariances between each variable (indicating a lack of heavy tails). Perfect collinearity means that a variable can be written as an exact linear combination of other variables. Logically, there is no clear relation between pupil-teacher ratios, lunch subsidy eligibility levels, and teacher salaries such that any of these could be explained as a combination of the others. Knowing a district’s lunch subsidy levels and teacher salaries will not indicate the pupil-teacher ratios, for example.

This is confirmed in the variable correlation matrix shown in Figure \@ref(fig:blp-corr-matrix), which demonstrates that there are finite covariances and that none of the variables (independent or dependent) are correlated. Note that `percent_free_and_reduced` is used in place of `lunch_subsidy_eligibility` since a metric variable is required for correlation calculation (`lunch_subsidy_eligibility` is a binned categorical representation of `percent_free_and_reduced` -- see Data Consolidation section). As a result, a unique B.L.P. does, in fact, exist.

```{r blp-corr-matrix, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5.5, fig.cap="Model Independent Variable Correlation Matrix"}

x <- c("truancy_rate", "pupil_teacher_fte_ratio", "percent_free_and_reduced", "average_salary")

corr <- round(cor(df.d[,x]), 2)

ggcorrplot(corr,
           hc.order = FALSE,
           outline.color = "white",
           colors = c("#003f5c", "white", "#ffa600"),
           lab = TRUE,
           show.legend = FALSE,
           digits = 2)
  
```

## Structural Limitations

### Omitted Variables

As described in the Causal Model and Research Design sections earlier, there are numerous omitted variables related to the school, the student as an individual, and school influences (see Figure 1). Many of these features are interrelated and have a complex relationship with truancy, being positively or negatively biased depending on the combination of features (e.g., age and interests) and we are not equipped to comment generally on the direction of their bias. Some of the more relevant and comprehensible omitted variables include:

* A school’s grade levels (e.g., elementary, middle, junior high, high)
  - At a young age, truancy is largely a function of the parent/guardian due to supervision and a lack of independence. As students age, the onus of attendance shifts to them.
  - As age increases we expect truancy to increase as well, yielding a bias away from zero.

### Reverse Causality
None of our background variables have a reverse causality relationship with our outcome variable, truancy rates:

* *Pupil-Teacher Ratio*: The number of students and teachers is a function of school board budgeting and planning. These values are determined before the start of the school year, thus truancy for the current school year could not influence the pupil-teacher ratio.
* *Lunch Subsidy Eligibility*: Whether a student is eligible for subsidized lunches is purely a function of the student and their family/guardian. Note that eligibility does not mean that the student is utilizing free or reduced lunches, but that they are eligible based on federal criteria.
* *Teacher Average Salary*: Similar to pupil-teacher ratio, teacher salaries are a function of budgeting and planning and are determined before the start of the school year. Truancy of one school year does not impact the average teacher salary of that year.
    
    
### Outcome Variables on Both Sides of Equation
For a given school year, truancy rates do not go into the determination of pupil-teacher ratios, lunch subsidy eligibility rates, or teacher average salaries. There is likely a relation between years (e.g., high truancy rates one year may lead to administrative action to be implemented the following year), but since our study solely investigates the school year of 2018-2019 such an effect does not exist.
